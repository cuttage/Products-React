# Shop Sample App in React and Vite: Homepage and Product Page Showcase

## Scripts

### dev

`npm run dev`

### build

`npm run build`

### preview

`npm run preview`

### notes

The current implementation does not allow clicking on the logo and the Shop menu item. This is because they were not explicitly required for the purpose of this demonstration, and we implemented navigation using the bottom menu and breadcrumb.
The desktop view brand menu differs from the Figma layout, as there are many brands in the implementation compared to the few brands in the Figma layout. The Figma layout is not suitable for this scenario.

### nice to have

Currently, there is no functionality available to revert to the full shop view containing all the products in the initial load with cleared filters. This feature was not part of the explicit requirements, hence it has not been implemented.
